\title{LUMS Stepper 2.0 -- universal 3-axis stepper motor controller}
\author{Kacper Oreszczuk}
\date{}
\begin{document}

\maketitle
 \section{Motivation}
Stepper motors are commonly used in laboratory. They are powering x-y-z translation stages, tunable filters, polarisation optics and many other devices. The goal of this project is to replace commercially available drivers with a cheaper, more reliable and more universal solution. 

\subsection*{Cost:}
Commercially available stepper motor drivers designed for laboratory use can reach prices
of a few hundred US\ Dollars for a single axis. Proposed solution costs about \$40 per axis with small
labour cost.

\subsection*{Quality:}
Personal experience in our laboratory revealed problems with microstep precision in drivers supplied by one of the leading laboratory equipment manufacturers. I have tested thoroughly stepper motor chip before choosing it for this project. 
\subsection*{Features:}
Custom solution allowed me to implement important additional features. The most important is automatic compensation of mechanical hysteresis.

\section{Hardware design}

Single device is able to control three bipolar stepper motors with 1/64 microsteps precision. Maximum current is about \SI{2.0}{A} per motor and the supply voltage must be between \SI{7}{V} and \SI{24}{V}.
Low level motor driving operation  is performed by\textit{TMC2226} driver on \textit{Stepstick} breakout board. Three such drivers are connected to \textit{NUCLEO144}  board with \textit{STM32H723ZG} microcontroller. Nucleo board connected via on-board \textit{FT232RL}\ USB-UART controller to computer provides virtual serial port for communication and power for logic layer of device. Separate power connector is provided on main PCB for motor operation and six high-density D-SUB15 female connectors for motors and encoders. Full schematics of the device is presented in Figure \ref{schematics}. PCB board is double-sided. It is advised to order PCB with SMD\ assembly. See Figure \ref{pcb} for PCB layout.  The driver is confined in 3D-printed case (Figure \ref{case}) protecting it and allowing mounting to optic table.

\section{Software and protocol}

Driver has two basic operation modes - movement with given velocity or movement to given position. In either of the cases the movement of motor is smoothed at starting and stopping. For user convenience speeds and positions are expressed in real units (for example millimeters in case of linear travel stage), not motor steps. End switches (limit switches) of different types are supported by this driver. They provide additional safety, as the driver will stop at the edge of the movement range of, for example, linear translation stage. Limit switches are also used to automatically calibrate absolute position of the stage.

When the mechanical setup of driven actuator is not completely rigid, the mechanical hysteresis can occur. Due to this effect real position of the  actuator depends on the direction from which set position is approached. In this project user can specify the amplitude od mechanical hysteresis. Algorithm will track previous movements and compensate the offsets in a manner transparent for the user.  

User can communicate with LUMS Stepper via virtual serial port provided by Nucleo board. Protocol of communication is based on single line plain-text commands initiated from computer and on single line reply from driver. For protocol description please refer to Table \ref{protocol}. Full list of accepted commands is presented in Table \ref{commands}

\section{How to set-up Stepper 2.0 in pyLUMS software}
This section is very specific to LUMS laboratory.

In order to control Stepper 2.0 from pyLUMS software, you need to configure it in \texttt{local\_devices.ini} and \texttt{devices.ini} file. Most of the work is put in the former one. Here is example of the relevant entry in \texttt{local\_devices.ini} file:

\begin{verbatim}
[stepperdevice]
name = My Stepper
class = misc.stepper.StepperWorker
req_port = 7040   
pub_port = 7041
id = LUMS01
current = 800,800,800
step = 0.005,0.005,0.005
encoder_step = 0.0001,0.0001,0.0001
velocity = 3,3,3
max_velocity = 3,3,3
hysteresis = 0.0012,0.0012,0.0012
homing_offset = 0,0,0
limit_type = 3,3,3
reversed = 0,1,1
acceleration_time = 0.20,0.20,0.20
\end{verbatim}

The meaning of each parameter is described in the table \ref{localdevicesini}.


\begin{table}[H]\centering
\begin{tabularx}{\textwidth}{lX}
\rowcolor[gray]{0.80} Parameter: & Description  \\
\rowcolor[gray]{0.95} id & The id of the given driver. \vspace{2mm} \\
\rowcolor[gray]{0.95} current & (for each axis) Move current (in mA) At rest the current is automatically reduced. \vspace{2mm} \\
\rowcolor[gray]{0.95} step & (for each axis) The distance in the user units corresponding to a single motor step. It does not directly affect the driver, only the values presented to the user.\vspace{2mm} \\
\rowcolor[gray]{0.95} encoder\_step & (optional, for each axis) Distance between encoder marks in the user units. It is relevant only for the stages fitted with the encoder.  \vspace{2mm} \\
\rowcolor[gray]{0.95} velocity  & (for each axis) Default move velocity in the user units per second. Note the user can request moving with different velocity.  \\
\rowcolor[gray]{0.95} max\_velocity & (for each axis) Maximum move velocity in user units per second for each axis. The software will prohibit the user to go beyond this value. \\
\rowcolor[gray]{0.95} hysteresis & (optional, for each axis) ... \vspace{2mm} \\
\rowcolor[gray]{0.95} homing\_offset & (optional, for each axis) ... \vspace{2mm} \\
\rowcolor[gray]{0.95} limit\_type & (optional, for each axis) Definition of the limit switches. Possible options: 0 -- no limit switches, ...  \vspace{2mm} \\
\rowcolor[gray]{0.95} acceleration\_time & (optional, for each axis) Time in seconds to smoothly reach the moving velocity. \vspace{2mm} \\
\end{tabularx}
\caption{Parameters specified in \texttt{local\_devices.ini} file if you use pyLUMS software}\label{localdevicesini}
\end{table}

Compared to multiple parameters defined above, the configuration in \texttt{devices.ini}  file is relatively simple. Basically you need to match the number of the ports, e.g.:
\begin{verbatim}
[stepper]
class = misc.stepper.Stepper
req_port = 7040
pub_port = 7041
\end{verbatim}
